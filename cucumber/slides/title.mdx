## Writting a better cucumber

```
Given I install the app
And I type "080802432" in mdn field
And I type "kddi0077" in password field
And I press "ok" button
When I see privacy policy page
And I check on the agree on terms checkbox
And I press "next" button
....
Then I should be on home screen 
```

---

## Describe behaviour

```
Given I am logged in as "tsukasapo" user 
And I complete the provisioning
Then I should see home screen
```

---

## Why descrative style?

* Easy to understand
* Easy to reuse
* Resilient to UI changes

<!-- note
remember this will be used and read by other ppl
-->

## More example

```
Scenario: I can create a campaign
  Given I visit "/campaigns/create"
  When I type "campaign12324" in the campaign name field
  And I select "alert" category in the campaign category field
  And I type "campaign test" in the notification title field
  ....
  Then I should see "Success! Campaign was created" on "/campaigns/create/summary"
```

---

## Keep scenario short and sweet

```
Scenario: I can create a campaign
  When I set content information
  And I set segmentation details
  And I set delivery schedule 
  And I schedule a campaign 
  Then I should see success message
```

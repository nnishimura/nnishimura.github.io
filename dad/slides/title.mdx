<!-- note
* In the middle-high school, I wanted to become a musician. I had a music band, playing the gutaier and singing
* But everyday after the school, I practice in the band so breaking the curfew everyday.
* My family were very strict, they don't want girls to play guitar, they want girls to play the piano. also they wanted me to study instead of playing the music, so there was no way they would allow me playing in the band. - at least thats what i thought.
* what I did was very very bad. Instead of telling the truth, I lied to them and I told them that I was studying in the library
* But one day, my mom saw me in the city and she learnt what I was doing
* She got mad and took my guitar and hide it somewhere
* I was crying everyday but sometime
* after a while, one day, suddenly all was ok. He got back the guitar
* he talked to mom
* It must have been hard for him to support it, because he does not belong to
* this is one of very small things, but I really appreciate him for getting back my guitar.
